			<td><h3>GOAL SUMMARY</h3>
				<p>Goal 2 aims to end hunger and malnutrition by 2030, and to ensure access to safe, nutritious and sufficient food. 
				Our planet has provided us with tremendous resources, but unequal access and inefficient handling 
				leaves millions of people malnourished. If we promote sustainable agriculture with modern technologies
				and fair distribution systems, we can help sustain the whole world’s population and help make sure that
				nobody will ever suffer from hunger again.<p></td>
			
			<td><p>PROBLEM STATEMENT 1:</p>
				<p>Build a solution that can help to double productivity for small scale food producers in your community.
				This solution could be financial or allow them access opportunities, bigger markets etc.</p>

				<p>OVERVIEW - HELP DOUBLE THE PRODUCTIVITY AND INCOMES OF SMALL_SCSLE FOOD PRODUCERS</p>

				<p>If your community can double the agricultural production and income of small-scale food producers, in particular women, family farmers, animal and fish farmers, by creating access to to land, technical knowledge, financial services, markets and opportunities then we can double the 	productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers.</p>

## Contributing
If this project sounds interesting to you and you'd like to contribute, thank you!
First, you can send a mail to buildforsdg@andela.com to indicate your interest, why you'd like to support and what forms of support you can bring to the table, but here are areas we think we'd need the most help in this project :
1.  area one (e.g this app is about human trafficking and you need feedback on your roadmap and feature list from the private sector / NGOs)
2.  area two (e.g you want people to opt-in and try using your staging app at staging.project-name.com and report any bugs via a form)
3.  area three (e.g here is the zoom link to our end-of sprint webinar, join and provide feedback as a stakeholder if you can)
